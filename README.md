Avalon is one of my favorite social deduction games. In this project, I will be building AI Agents to play Avalon. 

## Phases
1. Foundation and System Architecture
    - Create game engine and rule implementation
    - Design agent architecture framework
        - Observation processing
        - Memory/context management
        - Reasoning/decision making
        - Communication generation
    - Implement basic prompting strategies for different agent roles
    - Establish evaluation metrics and logging infrastructure
    - Set up infrastructure for collecting agent interactions and game outcomes
